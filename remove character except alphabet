Sample Input 1

This is my program




import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
        String str=s.nextLine();
   StringBuffer res=new StringBuffer();
        for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++){
            char c=str.charAt(i);
            
            if(Character.isLetter(c) || Character.isWhitespace(c)){
            res.append(c);
            }
            
        }
        System.out.print(res);
       
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
    }
}
